This repository contains an automated Google Chrome extension designed to facilitate posting in Facebook groups. The extension utilizes a CSV file that includes the target group link, the path to the video file (please ensure that all video files are stored in the same directory as the other project files), and the desired caption for each post.

Initially, I attempted to implement posting via clipboard automation; however, Facebook restricts clipboard access during automated actions. As a result, I adopted the current approach.

Important Note:
Facebook frequently updates its web elements, including their element, outerHTML, jsPath, xpath, and full xpath attributes. Therefore, you may need to update these selectors in the extension code to ensure continued functionality.
